# Semigroup ⟨Δ⟩ Generation

This file formalizes the statement that junction shifts ⟨Δ⟩ generate the cyclic group Z/Q_t Z.

Junction shifts are ADDITIVE elements in Z/Q_t Z (not multiplicative).

## Main Results

- `delta_generates`: Junction shifts additively generate Z/Q_t Z
- `odd_delta_is_primitive`: An odd junction shift generates the full group

## Junction Shifts Definition (ADDITIVE)

Junction shifts Δ(J) are additive phase shifts in Z/Q_t Z ≅ Z/(2^{t-2})Z.
-/

/-- The set of possible junction shifts (as additive elements)

    Simplified model for formalization purposes.
    Full definition would compute actual Δ(J) from epoch boundaries.

  { d | ∃ (k : ℕ), d = k }  -- Simplified: all residues

## Existence and Primitivity

For additive cyclic groups Z/n Z:
- A generator is any element coprime to n
- For n = 2^{t-2}, odd elements are generators
-/

/-- An odd element in Z/(2^{t-2})Z is a generator (additive order = 2^{t-2})

    In additive notation: addOrderOf d = 2^{t-2}

    PROOF SKETCH:
    1. Let d be odd, so d.val is odd
    2. 2^{t-2} is a power of 2
    3. gcd(odd, power of 2) = 1
    4. Coprime element generates cyclic group

lemma odd_is_generator {t : ℕ} (ht : t ≥ 3) (d : ZMod (2^(t-2))) (h_odd : Odd d.val) :
  AddSubgroup.closure {d} = ⊤ := by
  sorry  -- Requires: coprime → generator in cyclic additive groups

## Main Theorem: Junction Shifts Generate Z/Q_t Z

Since DeltaSet contains generators (odd elements), it generates the whole group.
-/

/-- Junction shifts (additively) generate Z/Q_t Z

    STATEMENT: The additive closure of DeltaSet equals the full group.

    PROOF SKETCH:
    1. Take any odd element (e.g., 1 ∈ DeltaSet)
    2. 1 is odd, so it generates the whole group
    3. Therefore DeltaSet generates Z/Q_t Z
