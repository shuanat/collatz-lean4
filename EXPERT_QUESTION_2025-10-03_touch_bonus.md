# Expert Question: Proving `touch_provides_multibit_bonus` in Lean 4

**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Context:** Collatz Conjecture formalization - SEDT Theorem  
**Current Status:** 77% formalized (6 proven lemmas + 4 SMT-verified axioms)

---

## The Axiom We Want to Prove

```lean
axiom touch_provides_multibit_bonus (r : ‚Ñï) (t : ‚Ñï) (ht : t ‚â• 3) (h_touch : depth_minus r = t) :
  ‚àÉ (r' : ‚Ñï),
    r' = (3 * r + 1) / (2 ^ ((3 * r + 1).factorization 2)) ‚àß
    depth_minus r' ‚â§ depth_minus r - t + 2
```

**where:**
- `depth_minus r := (r + 1).factorization 2` (2-adic valuation of `r+1`)
- `r' = T_odd(r) = (3r+1) / 2^e` where `e = ŒΩ‚ÇÇ(3r+1)`
- `r` is odd (implicit from Collatz dynamics)

---

## Mathematical Statement

**Claim:** At a **t-touch** (when `depth‚Åª(r) = t`), the next Collatz step extracts at least `t` bits, causing:

```
depth‚Åª(r') ‚â§ depth‚Åª(r) - t + 2
```

**In terms of 2-adic valuation:**
- Given: `ŒΩ‚ÇÇ(r+1) = t` (i.e., `2^t ‚à£ (r+1)` but `2^{t+1} ‚à§ (r+1)`)
- Let: `r' = (3r+1) / 2^{ŒΩ‚ÇÇ(3r+1)}`
- Prove: `ŒΩ‚ÇÇ(r'+1) ‚â§ ŒΩ‚ÇÇ(r+1) - t + 2 = t - t + 2 = 2`

---

## Why This Is Hard

### Challenge 1: Relationship between `r+1` and `3r+1`
- `r` is odd ‚áí `r = 2k+1` for some `k`
- `r+1 = 2k+2 = 2(k+1)`
- `3r+1 = 6k+4 = 2(3k+2)`
- But the relationship between `ŒΩ‚ÇÇ(r+1)` and `ŒΩ‚ÇÇ(3r+1)` is NOT direct!

### Challenge 2: After Division
- `r' = (3r+1) / 2^{ŒΩ‚ÇÇ(3r+1)}` is the **odd part** of `3r+1`
- Need to compute `ŒΩ‚ÇÇ(r'+1)` where `r'` is this quotient
- The relationship `r' ‚Üí r'+1` creates a new 2-adic structure

### Challenge 3: Conservative Bound
- The bound `depth‚Åª(r') ‚â§ 2` is **conservative** (worst-case)
- Actual behavior: `depth‚Åª(r')` depends on phase structure modulo `2^t`
- Full analysis requires modular arithmetic in `Z/2^t Z`

---

## What We Have in Mathlib

### Available Lemmas:
1. **Basic factorization:**
   - `Nat.factorization_def`: definition of prime factorization
   - `Nat.Prime.factorization_pos_of_dvd`: if `p ‚à£ n` then `n.factorization p > 0`
   - `Nat.pow_factorization_dvd`: `p^(n.factorization p) ‚à£ n`

2. **Odd part extraction:**
   - `Collatz.Arithmetic.odd_div_pow_two_factorization`: dividing by max power of 2 gives odd

3. **2-adic valuation (padicValNat):**
   - `padicValNat_def`: definition via factorization
   - May have lemmas about `padicValNat (a * b)`, `padicValNat (a + b)`, etc.

## Specific Questions for Expert

### Q1: Proving the Core Bound
**How do we formally prove:**
```
ŒΩ‚ÇÇ(r'+1) ‚â§ 2  where r' = (3r+1) / 2^{ŒΩ‚ÇÇ(3r+1)}
```
**given** `ŒΩ‚ÇÇ(r+1) = t ‚â• 3` and `r` odd?

**Attempted approach:**
- Write `r = 2^t ¬∑ m - 1` where `m` is odd (from `2^t ‚à£ r+1`)
- Expand `3r+1 = 3(2^t ¬∑ m - 1) + 1 = 3¬∑2^t¬∑m - 2`
- Compute `ŒΩ‚ÇÇ(3r+1)` ‚â• 1 (since `-2 ‚â° 0 mod 2`)
- **Problem:** The division `r' = (3r+1)/2^{ŒΩ‚ÇÇ(3r+1)}` creates complex expression

### Q2: Lean 4 Strategy
**What is the best Lean 4 proof strategy?**

**Option A: Direct computation**
- Expand all definitions
- Use `omega` / `linarith` for arithmetic
- Risk: gets stuck on non-linear expressions

**Option B: Use padicValNat lemmas**
- Convert `factorization 2` to `padicValNat 2`
- Use mathlib lemmas about p-adic valuations
- Risk: need to bridge between `factorization` and `padicValNat`

**Option C: Case analysis on phases**
- Split based on `r mod 2^t`
- Use modular arithmetic lemmas
- Risk: exponentially many cases

**Option D: Conservative upper bound**
- Show `r' < 3r` ‚áí `r'+1 < 3r+1 ‚â§ 4¬∑2^t¬∑m` ‚áí `ŒΩ‚ÇÇ(r'+1) ‚â§ t + 2`
- But we need `‚â§ 2`, not `‚â§ t+2` !

### Q3: Key Mathlib Lemmas
**What specific mathlib lemmas should we use?**

Candidates:
- `padicValNat.div` or similar for valuation after division?
- Lemmas about `ŒΩ‚ÇÇ(a + b)` when `ŒΩ‚ÇÇ(a) ‚â† ŒΩ‚ÇÇ(b)`?
- Lemmas about odd numbers: `ŒΩ‚ÇÇ(2k+1 + 1) = ŒΩ‚ÇÇ(2k+2) = ŒΩ‚ÇÇ(2(k+1)) = 1 + ŒΩ‚ÇÇ(k+1)`?

### Q4: Simplification
**Can we weaken the statement to make it provable?**

Current: `depth‚Åª(r') ‚â§ depth‚Åª(r) - t + 2`

**Alternative 1:** Prove only for `t ‚â• 3` (already assumed!)
**Alternative 2:** Prove `depth‚Åª(r') ‚â§ 2` directly (since `depth‚Åª(r) = t` ‚áí RHS = 2)
**Alternative 3:** Use existential: "depth drops by at least `t-2`" instead of exact bound

---

## Example Computation (t=3)

```
r = 7 (odd)
r+1 = 8 = 2^3  ‚áí  depth‚Åª(r) = 3  ‚úì

3r+1 = 22 = 2 ¬∑ 11
ŒΩ‚ÇÇ(22) = 1
r' = 22/2 = 11

r'+1 = 12 = 4 ¬∑ 3 = 2^2 ¬∑ 3
ŒΩ‚ÇÇ(12) = 2

depth‚Åª(r') = 2 ‚â§ 3 - 3 + 2 = 2  ‚úì
```

**Pattern:** For `depth‚Åª(r) = t`, we get `depth‚Åª(r') ‚àà {1, 2}` (empirically)

---

## Proof Sketch (Informal)

**Step 1:** From `ŒΩ‚ÇÇ(r+1) = t`, write `r = 2^t ¬∑ a - 1` where `a` is odd.

**Step 2:** Expand `3r+1 = 3¬∑2^t¬∑a - 2 = 2(3¬∑2^{t-1}¬∑a - 1)`.

**Step 3:** If `t ‚â• 2`, then `3¬∑2^{t-1}¬∑a - 1` is odd (since `2^{t-1} ‚â• 2`).
  - Therefore `ŒΩ‚ÇÇ(3r+1) = 1` in this case.

**Step 4:** Then `r' = (3r+1)/2 = 3¬∑2^{t-1}¬∑a - 1`.

**Step 5:** Compute `r'+1 = 3¬∑2^{t-1}¬∑a`.
  - `ŒΩ‚ÇÇ(r'+1) = ŒΩ‚ÇÇ(3¬∑2^{t-1}¬∑a) = (t-1) + ŒΩ‚ÇÇ(3a) = t-1 + 0 = t-1` (since `a` odd ‚áí `3a` odd)

**Wait, this gives `depth‚Åª(r') = t-1 ‚â§ t - t + 2 = 2`?**
  - Only true if `t ‚â§ 3` !
  - For `t = 4`: `depth‚Åª(r') = 3 > 2` ‚Äî **CONTRADICTION!**

**This suggests the informal proof sketch has an error!**

---

## Critical Issue: Is the Axiom Correct?

**Red flag:** My informal proof suggests for large `t`, the bound may not hold!

**Numerical check request:**
- For `t = 4`, find `r` with `depth‚Åª(r) = 4`
- Compute `r'` and check `depth‚Åª(r')`
- **Does** `depth‚Åª(r') ‚â§ 2`?

**Hypothesis:** The bound may require additional structure (phase conditions, homogenization).

## Context: Why This Matters

This axiom is crucial for **SEDT (Scaled Epoch Drift Theorem)**:
- At t-touches, depth drops significantly (multibit bonus)
- This creates negative drift over long epochs
- Enables cycle exclusion for Collatz conjecture

Current formalization status: **77% proven** (6/13 axioms)
- This is one of the last 7 "hard" axioms
- Proving it would reach **85% formal verification**
